# Motivation
I think we all have some **notes** that we take from time to time.      
For the most part, a simple text document is all we need - **for the most part**.   
But, sometimes one wants a little **more**. After all, searching a huge text file is not the most pleasent thing ever, especially when the thing hits **1000 lines or more**.   
So, to me it makes sense to host a small **wiki** instance at home in the lab just for writing all those things down.   
Let's get right into it by self hosting **DokuWiki**.

Homepage of **DokuWiki**: https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki   
(Take a look at it's **features** there and you can also gather some good **information** on the site)

# What do you need
You need a **FreeBSD** (**FreeBSD** 14.3 amd64) install somewhere which we can use to harbor **DokuWiki**.   
There are no big requirements except a **webserver**, **PHP** and a little time to set it all up.   
You can of course leverage **Jails** or a **Bhyve VM** if you like to - that is up to the user of this guide.

# Installing the needed packages
First we need to install all the **necessary software** to host our **wiki**.   
Given that **FreeBSD** ships **DokuWiki**, **Apache** and **PHP packages** we can simply leverage **pkg** to quickly get up to speed.
```shell
$ sudo pkg install dokuwiki-php84-20250514a apache24 mod_php84
```
**Hint:** **DokuWiki** is currently available in **different PHP versions**. I selected the newest **PHP** incarnation here - **YMMV**

After the installation, let's activate the needed **services** (**Apache**, **PHP-FPM**)
```shell
$ sudo sysrc apache24_enable=YES
$ sudo sysrc php_fpm_enable=YES
```
We will start the given **services** later. For now we make our way over to **configuring**.

# Configure all the things!
We start by configuring **PHP-FPM** under **Apache**.   
Fire up your **editor** of choice and create */usr/local/etc/apache24/Includes/php.conf* with the following content
```shell
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
    SetHandler  "proxy:fcgi://localhost:9000"
</FilesMatch>
```
This will tell **Apache** how to handle **PHP** scripts.
**Hint:** You can do this on a per **VHost** basis. In my case here I will activate it globally. Again, **YMMV**

Now we edit */usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf* to load the **needed modules** while also setting up VHost support (Or to be precise, a **Include** which makes our life a little easier)
```shell
LoadModule proxy_module libexec/apache24/mod_proxy.so
...
LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module libexec/apache24/mod_proxy_fcgi.so
...
LoadModule php_module         libexec/apache24/libphp.so
...
# Include VHosts
Include etc/apache24/sites/*.conf
```
**Make sure to uncomment the above listed modules** and to add the final **Include**!

Since we include our **VHost** configs from sites/ we need to make sure the directory actually exists.
```shell
$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/apache24/sites
```
**Perfect!** So far so good. Let's head on to create the **VHost** site for our **wiki**.

# VHost fun
Create the file **wiki.conf** under */usr/local/etc/apache24/sites/* and paste in the following contents
```shell
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin x@seven.lan

        DocumentRoot "/usr/local/www/dokuwiki"

        <Directory "/usr/local/www/dokuwiki">
                DirectoryIndex index.php
                AllowOverride All
                Require all granted
        </Directory>

        ServerName wiki.seven.lan
</VirtualHost>
```
**Important:** Make sure you change **ServerAdmin** and **ServerName** to your own needs! This is merely a example that I've used in setting up everything. You for sure want to have another **ServerName** at the very least.

# A short note on DNS
As you could tell from the **VHost** config above, the VHost looks for **'wiki.seven.lan'**.   
That of course needs to be **changed by you**!   
If you leverage **Bind** for example you can add a **A Record** to make this all work.   
(Of course, you can also use a **CNAME** entry)
```shell
wiki   IN   A   10.0.5.50
```
Or, you might want to just do a **quick and dirty** edit in the */etc/hosts* file
```shell
10.0.5.50   wiki.seven.lan wiki
```
**This is up to you** - chose what you prefer!

# Permissions are fun
Before we start **Apache** and the **PHP-FPM** service we need to fix the permissions, **file permissions**, of our **DokuWiki** installation directory.   
Simply do the following:
```shell
$ cd /usr/local/www/dokuwiki
ยง sudo chown -R www:www .
```
**Easy**. Let's head over to the next step.

# Starting all the services!
Ready, set, **go**!
```shell
$ sudo service php_fpm start
$ sudo service apache24 start
```
**Apache** and **PHP** are started and running, so far so good.

# Webbrowser time
(The next steps assume that you've set up a **DNS Record** or a **hosts** entry!)   
In this case I will leverage **Firefox** to navigate to our newly installed **wiki**.
```shell
$ firefox http://wiki.seven.lan
```
![DokuWiki Setup Page](/images/dokuwiki-setup.png)
**Yes**, our **wiki** is **alive**!   
All you need to do here is to **create a Admin user** and **chose the license** of your choice.   
After all of that is done you will be greated with the starting page of **DokuWiki**.

# Closing words
Was that it?!   
**Yes**, you can now customize the **wiki** to your needs and do whatever your heart feels like.   
All in all, **DokuWiki** is a very viable solution which is also easy to handle.

That's it. **Have fun everyone!**
