Since I've already done a overview/resources list for **Debian** it is time to make one for **Arch Linux**.
Without babbling on forever, let's get this show on the road.

# Arch Wiki
The **Arch Linux** wiki is very well known to any **Linux** user - or at least should be.   
I will present a few interesting wiki pages/sites which I think help a lot in getting to know **Arch Linux** and which are generally helpful - no matter which distro one uses.

The first place to look at would be without a doubt the installation guide which holds many interesting bits.
- [Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)

If you are looking for things to do in general, setting up your **Linux** system, there is a page for that.
- [General recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations)

Maintaing a **Arch Linux** system is important and this wiki page has a lot of info about that.
- [System maintenance](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance)

Want to secure your **Arch Linux** installation? There you go.

If you are looking for applications to install check out the following wiki page.
- [List of applications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications)

There are also categories in the **Arch Linux** wiki which present some good information for a user.
The category **System administration** has some very good info.
- [Categorie: System administration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:System_administration)

Wanna boost your performance? There is a page on that as well.
- [Improving performance](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Improving_performance)

Most important is mastering the package manager **Pacman**. This page holds quite some useful hints.

Another good start for a new user.

Getting to know the **AUR**.

Another useful wiki page: The **ABS**

# More Arch Linux goodies
There are some other resources someone might want to check out. **Arch Linux** on the web so to speak!

First, one might want to subscribe to one or more **RSS** feeds.
I would highly recommend to at least subcribe to the **Arch Linux** News feed since important messages are distributed which directly concern users.
- [RSS Feeds](https://archlinux.org/feeds/)

There is also a dedicated page for **Man** pages.
- [Man pages](https://man.archlinux.org/)

And let's not forget the **Mirror** list generator.
- [Mirror list generator](https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/)

Maybe you want to hang out with fellow **Arch Linux** users in **IRC**.
- [IRC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_IRC_channels)

You can also get a sorted list of the newest package updates.
- [Package updates](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=-last_update)

**Arch Linux** also has mailing lists, if that is more your thing.
- [Mailing lists](https://lists.archlinux.org/mailman3/lists/)

And last but not least the excellent **Arch Linux** forums.

# A few words about Arch Linux
This was a little summary of important sites that pertain directly to **Arch Linux**.   
Covering everything is simply not feasable since the wiki alone is huge - **very huge**.

If you want to have a offline copy of the **Arch Linux Wiki** to selfhost said wiki you can install the **arch-wiki-docs** package.

There are endless possibilities in the end... so presenting every bit of information is simply overkill.

A good thing to do when looking for something is appending **"archlinux"** in your search engine of choice - which most of the times get's you where you want to go.

# Are we there yet?!
**Yes**, we are in fact.

This is intended as a **starting point** for new and experienced users to get to know **Arch Linux** a little better and provide a collection of useful links.

Last but not least...

**Stay Open!**
