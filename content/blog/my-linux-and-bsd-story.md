# Before FOSS
In the beginning there was... No, not gonna start like that.   

As most of you, I started with **Windows** back in the 90's. **Windows 98** was all the rage back then and I really did not care a lot about understanding the system I use better. **Gaming**, after all, was my introduction to computers in generel.   
Actually, gaming was introduced into my life in the form of consoles like the **NES** and **SNES**... but that is a story for another time.

The spark that really set of the entire computing fascination though came early - when we got a **DSL** connection. A young person like me truly had all the world in front of him... it was quite overwhelming. (Although the **Internet** of old was quite different from what it is now - sadly)   

For the first years, I was running **Windows** in one form or the other. From **Windows 98 (SE)** all the way to **Windows 7** - which I have very fond memories of.   

That is what it was: **Gaming** and **surfing** the **web**... and of course being showered with **multimedia** content from sites like **YouTube** later on etc..

# Linux entered the chat
Back in 2009 I found a Forum post about someone mentioning **Arch Linux**. Having dabbled with the idea of running **Linux** in a **VM** I quickly downloaded the **ISO** and began my first steps with this alien **OS** called **Linux**.   

I did not know anything at all, nothing... but I was hooked instantly. This also was back when **Arch Linux** had the **AIF** installer (Who remembers that ncurses based installer?). I installed it, slapped Fluxbox onto it and installed pretty much anything that pacman had to offer - it was wild!   

Coming from the **Windows** world it was so unusual to just install all the applications you need by issuing one command on the shell. **My mind was blown**!   

In the same year I also found two of my most beloved Linux distros:   
**Debian** and **Slackware**.   

I've ran **Linux** on anything I owned and fiddled way too much with any config file I could find.   
**Fun fact:** The thing is that I never borked my install to the point that they were **FUBAR** (Yet).  

For years I've ran my **NAS** with **Slackware** - which ran like a champ!   

I did entirely too much distro hopping and tried any **WM**/**DE** under the sun. It was truly exciting. Development was much easier, the system was faster and I had a lot to learn.   

And then...

# BSD came along
Yes, **BSD** came into the picture at around 2009 as well.   
It was **OpenBSD** that captured my imagination. The whole system and it's amazing documentation truly fascinated me - to this day!   
I still remember downloading the **4.5** (Games) **ISO** from the website and installing it on my **ThinkPad R500**. It worked smooth as butter. The layout, the man pages, the excellent FAQ - it was all great.   
And then **FreeBSD** followed suite shortly after.   
The experience was different from **OpenBSD** but in a good way. **FreeBSD** is more on the "do-it-yourself" side. This means you will start with a minimal base system and build everything from the ground up - this felt quite like a fresh **Arch** install.   
For a developer **BSD** also made a lot of sense. The code was/is clean and easy to follow for the most part. **GNU** code tends to be way more complex since it targets many more edge cases.
The communities are stronger than ever. May it be on **Mastodon**, **IRC** or **Matrix**, you can find **BSD** folks anywhere.

# Now
I run **Linux** and **BSD** all the time. In my **homelab** as well as at **work** to some extent.   

I have settled with **Arch Linux** and **Debian** on the **Linux** side and **FreeBSD** / **OpenBSD** on the **BSD** side.   

From **webhosting** to **specialized** use cases - they are both all over the place in my life.   
As a matter of fact I type this very article sitting on my **Debian** workstation right now.

# Final words
You may or may not like **Linux/BSD** and that is fine.   
For me personally it was true **enlightenment** having fun with both.   
It teached me so much that I can't even count the things I learned along the way. It was also always present in my career as a **sysadmin**.   

Enough babbling for now, let me get back to doing some **work**.

Last but not least...

**Stay Open!**
