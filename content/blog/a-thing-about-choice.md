# Choice - The enternal enemy
We all know well how much options are all around us...   
From simple things like what food to order all the way up to who to marry.

**Let's face it:** Choice is everywhere   

**Q:** Is it inherently a bad thing?   
**A:** No, not at all.   

**The enemy is ourself**. We **procrastinate forever** on which thing to do or not to do.   

This is where choice shows it's ugly face.

# Paradox of choice
The problem stems from the simple fact that in our modern world there are **too many choices** available to us.   
And no, I'm not against having many things to pick from - I have a problem with overthinking what to pick in the end.

This very much is the **paradox of choice**.

**Barry Schwartz** wrote a book about this very problem:   
[The Paradox of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice)

# Decisions
We've all been in the situation where we were forced to pick something.   
I get it, it is great to have **variety** - to **some extent** that is.   
In the old days you either picked **X** or **Y**. Nothing more and nothing less.

We are **bombarded** with alternatives nowadays which **makes it hard to select anything** at all.   

Imagine having to pick one **Linux distribution** for the rest of your life...   
Welcome to the never ending "**The grass is greener on the other side**" mentality.

**Q:** Can one even make a perfect pick?   
**A:** No, and that is not the point when making decisions.

# A fresh look
Imagine for a moment that whatever you picked was the right choice - no matter what it was.   
Imagine also that product **X** does exactly what you want
And last but not least, imagine yourself being content with your selection.

*That's it, literally.*

Our **brain** constantly tells us that something else might be better suited for us. The only thing our brain is not telling us is **if it even matters**.

There is a name for that: **Shiny new syndrome**. **FOMO**.

# Missing something
**Reality is not always what it seems**.   
Just because we are provided with many things to chose from does not mean that we have to pick anything in the end.

Do you go to **Distrowatch** for example and change your **distro** everytime something new hits the ranking?   
I suspect only a handful of people would do that at all.

Besides: **Choice only makes sense when there is a need for it**.

If you drank **Sprite** all your life and you love it why force yourself to drink the new Sprite++ when you are totally happy with what you got?!.

**This is where our mind plays a trick on us**.   
The so called **fear of missing out**.

# A lesson in reality
If we struggle to select anything, **why even bother**?   
Life is not forever... and thinking that we can do it all is not possible.

**Fun fact**: Everyone on this very planet (Aliens in other worlds excluded of course) is constantly missing out, **period**!

**That is a fact**.   

So, let me ask again: **What will your choice be**?   
If you answer "**I don't know**" you might have just grown a little.   
Because we do not know before we actually select/use something.

# Does it matter?
**No, not in the slightest**.

Don't let your mind **fool you** into making life harder by constantly changing from **A** to **Z**.

Use what you have and have an open mind.   

**Don't jump** onto any **new bandwagon** just for the sake of it!

If I were to collect any **NES** / **SNES** game I would be brankrupt. Still, I do miss out on that in a strict sense.    
The point here is that it is totally fine to not give into something new and making choices all the time.   

**It is about having fun** - not struggling with making choices!

# So, what now?
**Be yourself and use what you use**.   

Don't indulge yourself into making **choices**/**decisions** when there is no need to do so.

**Happiness** in life is something not many people have. Our lifes are a constant up and down - which is hard enough as it is.

**Think about what you want/need**. Focus on your experience as a human.

And for the love of all that is holy: **Reject FOMO**

# Final words
This was just a **small rant** about having too many choices - something that to me is very real.   
I do not intend for this very text to be the final truth on the matter, far from it.   

I merely liked to give **my point of view** and hopefully inspire someone at the end of the day.

**Remember**: Life is a **journey**, not a game show where all the choices need to be perfect.

Hope that you all have a good day!

**Stay Open!**
