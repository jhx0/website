Lately I've been thinking about **putting together** a little **blog post** on where to find **information/help/guides/etc.** on **Debian**.   
So, long story short, this is a **collection** of useful **Debian** related links/sites that might come in handy when looking for some **information**.

# Link galore
**Debian** itself provides quite a large amount of **documentation**. The only problem is **finding all of that**.   
The **Debian** website itself makes questionable usability choices IMHO - but that is pertaining to myself (And maybe others).   
**To be honest:** The website itself is rather a **maze**... finding something can be a chore in itself.   
But we are not here to discuss the shortcomings of said website, no, we are here for some links with all the juicy information we crave!

The first thing to check might be the **Debian Wiki** itself.   
- [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/)   

**NOTE:** You can find quite some information on there... but it is not as comprehensive as the **Arch Linux** Wiki by any means. Still, a good candidate.

Another good place to stop by are the **release notes** for the current **Debian release**:   
- [Debian Release Notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes)

The **Debian docs** sub page packs quite some interesting information such as the **FAQ** and the famous **Securing Debian Manual**:   
- [Debian Doc's](https://www.debian.org/doc/)

Have a look also at the **FAQ**:   
- [Debian FAQ](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/)

..And the **Securing Debian Manual**:   
- [Securing Debian Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/index.en.html)

A lot of **FAQ's** can be found on the **dedicated Debian Wiki page**:   
- [Debian FAQ Collection (Wiki)](https://wiki.debian.org/FAQ)

If you are more into having something **more comprehensive** that you can read like a **book** have a look at the excellent **Debian Administrator's Handbook**.   
It goes over everything **Debian** related and is a great source no matter if you are new or a seasoned user.   
- [Debian Administrator's Handbook](https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/)

Also, I highly recommend to have a look at the **Debian Reference**:   
- [Debian Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/index.en.html)

If you want to have more information on a given **package** you can check the **Debian Tracker**:   
- [Debian Tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/)

In need of a **Man** page on the go?   
**Debian** has got you covered:   
- [Debian Manpages](https://manpages.debian.org/)

**Bugs are a fact of life** - and no software is perfect. I sometimes want to lookup something or a problem on a given **package/program**. The **Debian Bug Tracking System** is a good starting point before wildly searching for something on the web:    
- [Debian Bug Tracker](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/)

There is also the **Security Tracker** that can come in quite handy:
- [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker)

One site I often visit is the **Debian Packages** site. Here you can search/query for packages at your hearts desire:   
- [Debian Packages](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages)

So, cool thing. What if you need some help or you want to ask a question pertaining to **Debian**?   
**No worries**, there is the **Debian User Forum** which has you covered:   
- [Debian Forum](https://forums.debian.net/)

Another need thing is having the **Debian Reference Card**:
- [Debian Reference Card (PDF)](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/refcard/refcard.en.pdf)

# German only resoures
There are some additional sites one can visit given he or she is **speaking German**.

There is for example the excellent **German Debianforum**:   
- [Debian Forum (DE)](https://debianforum.de/forum/)

Also, the **Ubuntuusers Wiki** is quite nice to browse:   
- [Ubuntuusers Wiki](https://debianforum.de/forum/)

**NOTE:** The information pertains to **Ubuntu** but can be used on **Debian** as well. Make sure to watch out for **Ubuntu** specific articles/entries and adjust accordingly.

# Non-Debian specific resources
There are many more websites out there holding information about **Debian** and other **Linux Distro's** as well.   
Here are some picks from me that I use although they don't directly pertain to **Debian**.   
Since **Linux is Linux**, most of the information is useful no matter if you run **Debian** or something else entirely.

We have to mention the excellent **Arch Linux Wiki** - there is no way around it:   
- [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page)   

**NOTE:** **Hands down**, the **Arch Linux** Wiki is by far one of the **most comprehensive Wiki's** out there - and that is a **fact**!

I also sometimes browse the **Gentoo** Wiki which offers some insight only a source based distro can deliver:   
- [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page)

Another great wiki is the **Slackware** Wiki. There are some really interesting articles to be found there:   
- [Slackware Doc's](https://docs.slackware.com/)

# Final words
There sure are more sites specific to **Debian** that could have been named here. The selection I've made here mostly caters to my own needs. Nonetheless I've found it good to **centralize** some of these links for the next person to have some kind of overview of what is available.   
As with everything in life, new information is created, new documents are written, new websites are created... you get the idea - **Information changes as life changes**!   

I hope this gives you the reader some **pointers** on where to find **information on the web**.

As always, **Stay Open** everyone!

...And **Enjoy**!
