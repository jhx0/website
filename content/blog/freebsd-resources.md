I did a resource list for **Debian** and **Arch Linux** so far... so why not do the same for **FreeBSD**!
Let's get right to it!

# FreeBSD link galore
The premier resource for anything **FreeBSD** is hands down the superb **FreeBSD Handbook**.
- [FreeBSD Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/)

There is a lot of coverage in the **Handbook** from the basics all the way to advanced topics.

Another great wealth of information can be found in the **Manual Pages** in general.
- [FreeBSD Man Pages](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi)

Maybe you are interested in becoming a developer?...  
**FreeBSD** has you covered!
- [FreeBSD Dev Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/developers-handbook/)

Or you might want to port a application to **FreeBSD**.
- [FreeBSD Porters Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/)

A good first start can also be done by reading the **FAQ**.
- [FreeBSD FAQ](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/)

Plenty of useful information can also be found on the **Mailing List** - or you can ask a question there.
- [FreeBSD Mailing Lists](https://www.freebsd.org/community/mailinglists/)

Maybe you like forums more and there interaction. **FreeBSD** has a forum full of dedicated members.
- [FreeBSD Forum](https://forums.freebsd.org/)

You might want to join a **User Group** to engage with some like minded **FreeBSD** people.
- [User Groups](https://www.freebsd.org/usergroups/)

There is also a really handy page dedicated to new users.
- [FreeBSD Newbies](https://www.freebsd.org/projects/newbies/)

Let's of course not forget the **FreeBSD Wiki**.
- [FreeBSD Wiki](https://wiki.freebsd.org/)

# Outside FreeBSD.org
A great way to search for software is directly in the browser leveraging **Fresh Ports**.
- [Fresh Ports](https://www.freshports.org/)

Checking the compatibility of your hadware needed? Look no further.
- [BSD Hardware](http://bsd-hardware.info/)

Vermaden's excellent **FreeBSD** centered blog - Great source of information.
- [Vermaden's Blog](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/)

The **FreeBSD** Reddit community.
- [r/freebsd](https://www.reddit.com/r/freebsd/)

And let's not forget the **BSD NOW** podcast.
- [BSD NOW](https://www.bsdnow.tv/)

Of course one has to mention the **BSD Cafe**!
- [BSD Cafe](https://bsd.cafe/)

# YouTube Channels
This is a incomplete listing of some **FreeBSD** centric **YouTube** channels - i'm sure there are more channels out there. Don't feel bad if I forgot your particular channel.

Cools Bits and Such (BSDJedi)

# Last words
I'm certain that this is a incomplete resources list and that there is much more out there in the wild.   
The **FreeBSD** ecosystem is by no means small - quite the opposite!

Hopefully this will help someone get some use out of the links provided here.

Last but not least...

**Stay Open!**
