# Hey there! 👋

**Welcome** to my tiny corner in the ocean which is the [**web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)!

My name is **Julian** ("**jhx**") and I currently live and work on this [**planet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth).

## Computing 🖥️

I'm deeply interested in [**Information technology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) ([**Operating Systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), [**Security**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security), [**Networking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)).  
(I also quite enjoy [**Retro Computing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing) - or systems from the past in general)

Little old me loves [**GNU/Linux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [**BSD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution). Sometimes I dabble with [**Windows**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) as well.  
[**Free Software**](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or [**FOSS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) is what I use all the time - and what I **prefer**!

## Gaming 🎮

[**Retro gaming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrogaming) is a great pastime of mine ([**Consoles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console) and [**PC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer)).  
I play some modern games from time to time as well! (On [**Linux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [**Windows**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows))   
Also, I'm a fan of [**Wine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)).

## Programming ⌨️

Yes, I also do some [**programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) for fun. I have a couple of languages that I'm interested in.
Check out my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/jhx0/) page and maybe find something useful!

## Channel 📽️

Check out my [**Odysee**](https://odysee.com/@YetanotherSysAdmin:0) and [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@YetAnotherSysAdmin) channel "**Yet Another SysAdmin**", if you like.

## Contact 📫

In the [**Fedi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) realm I can be found either on [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@jhx) or on the excellent [**bsd.cafe**](https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@jhx) instance.

You can also reach me via [**Email**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) at **jhx0x00** at **gmail** dot **com**  
(For all the **oldschool** people out there)

## Last but not least...

One of my favorite quotes from the [**UNIX**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) legend [**Dennis Ritchie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie):

> UNIX is basically a simple operating system, 
> but you have to be a genius to understand it's simplicity.

That's all.. **have fun** and **stay open**! 😎
